# cubon_public
The public repository for my possibly cancelled game, cubon

## How to use
to use and edit the source, simply open the folder in unity 6000.3.4f1.
make sure to go to "project settings>player>active input handling" and set it to "both", the restart the editor.

## Making new scenes?
press ctrl+n and select "default room" or whatever

## Verdict?

have fun! this is a simple project, so it should be very easy to modify

## Why this exists
in the case that cubon gets canceled, I want fans to be able to use the base platformer engine to make their own cubon, how they see it.
